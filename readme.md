# Teeny-Compiler

A simple compiler for a BASIC-like grammar into C, following the blogpost at https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html , written "in my own words" in rust.

Just a small project to get myself reaquainted with the language, likely with messy code as a result.

Planning to complete this in the coming days.
